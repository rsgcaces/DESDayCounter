## Beginnings
Back in 2018, D. Dadyburjor and E. Peterson had the idea to combine a large custom-designed 7-Segment display with a 7-band graphic equalizer in a 3D-printed that functioned well as a standalone, programmable device. The unit functioned well for a time before succumbing to the elements.

## 2025 Update
In preparation for an ICS3U-E lesson on Radio Frequency in the spring of 2025, Mr. D. returned to the Day Counter project idea over the 2025 March Break. The concept was to embed an nRF24L01-based receiver in the Day Counter wall unit that would be responsive to a manual transmitter on Mr. D.'s desk, updated through the turning of a rotary encoder. A successful prototype was achieved.
